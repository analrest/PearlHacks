DOG-BREED-GAME

---Stil in Progress---

A game created to test users knowledge on dog breeds using TKinter. This game was originally created during the Pearl Hacks Hackathon, but has been improved significantly since. Users will be given a picture of a dog along with four options to choose from. Users have a limited number of lives while working to correctly answer 15 questions in order to win the game. If the user selects an incorrect answer that button will turn red and they will lose a life. Users can now exit the game or return to the starting page at any point during the game. Users will also not be asked the same question twice.
